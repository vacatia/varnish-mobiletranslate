Varnish Mobile Detect
=======================

###Goal:
Drop-in varnish solution to mobile user detection based on the https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect library.

###How:
A VCL script that adds a `X-UA-Device` header to the request.

Device Type|X-UA-Device
-----------|------------
Phone      |  phone
Tablet     |  tablet
Other      |  desktop

###Requirements
Varnish 3 is a requirement. If you venture running this with Varnish 2, there is no gurantee for support. 
It is also helpful to know understand the basics of the VCL language and workflow. 
This is not a VMOD module, so no compiling is required. 

###Installation
1. Download the mobile_detect.vcl file into your vcl config directory. `/etc/varnish/`
 * `wget https://raw2.github.com/willemk/varnish-mobiletranslate/master/mobile_detect.vcl`
2. Include the `mobile_detect.vcl` in your `default.vcl` file (See examples below)
3. Call `devicedetect` from vcl_recv in varnish (See examples below)

###Usage
####Sample use case: Different back ends
Using a different backend for mobile than for desktop 
```
include "mobile_detect.vcl";

backend mobile {
    .host = "10.0.0.1";
    .port = "80";
}

sub vcl_recv {

    call devicedetect;

    if (req.http.X-UA-Device ~ "^mobile") {
        set req.backend = mobile;
    }
}

```
####Sample use case: Normalize the user-agent string for the backend
The backend receives the simplified user-agent generated by the mobile_detect. The backend can then serve different content accordingly. It will then cache it by device type.
```
include "mobile_detect.vcl";

sub vcl_recv {

    call devicedetect;

    if (req.http.X-UA-Device) {
        set req.http.User-Agent = req.http.X-UA-Device;
        unset req.http.X-UA-Device;
    }
}

sub vcl_hash {
    #Default Hash
    hash_data(req.url);
    if (req.http.host) {
        hash_data(req.http.host);
    } else {
        hash_data(server.ip);
    }
    
    #Also hash based on device type
    if (req.http.X-UA-Device) {
        hash_data(req.http.X-UA-Device);
    }
    
    return (hash);
}

```

####Sample use case: Cache based on device type
If your backend generates the different content for the same URL based on device type, it should be cached accoding to that device type. 
```
include "mobile_detect.vcl";

sub vcl_recv {

    call devicedetect;

}

sub vcl_hash {
    #Default Hash
    hash_data(req.url);
    if (req.http.host) {
        hash_data(req.http.host);
    } else {
        hash_data(server.ip);
    }
    
    #Also hash based on device type
    if (req.http.X-UA-Device) {
        hash_data(req.http.X-UA-Device);
    }
    
    return (hash);
}

```
